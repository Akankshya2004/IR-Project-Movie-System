Hutter's trek is an unusual one, with many locals not wanting to take him near the castle where strange events have been occurring. Once at the castle, Hutter does manage to sell the Count the house, but he also notices and feels unusual occurrences, primarily feeling like there is a dark shadow hanging over him, even in the daytime when the Count is unusually asleep. Hutter eventually sees the Count's sleeping chamber in a crypt, and based on a book he has recently read, believes the Count is really a vampire or Nosferatu. While Hutter is trapped in the castle, the Count, hiding in a shipment of coffins, makes his way to Wisbourg, causing death along his way, which most attribute to the plague. Hutter himself tries to rush home to save his town and most importantly save Ellen from Nosferatu's imminent arrival. In Wisbourg, Ellen can feel the impending darkness as Nosferatu gets closer. But she learns that a sinless woman can sacrifice herself to kill the vampire. Will Hutter be able to save Ellen either from Nosferatu and/or her self-sacrifice?",

To be the most popular student, he will have to outdo the current most popular student, football captain Chet Trask. Unaware Speedy's task is made all the more difficult when one of the upperclassmen, seeing how hard Speedy is trying to impress, does whatever he can to make Speedy look all the more ridiculous, all the while Speedy believing he is achieving his dream. The bully's efforts are made all the more easy as Speedy is able to buy his way to seeming popularity with the small nest egg he was able to accumulate from work. The one thing that Speedy may not be able to buy is his way onto the football team, which he is convinced is the only surefire way to becoming the campus hero, despite not realizing that he truly is not the football type. While Speedy remains unaware how he truly looks to his classmates, Peggy, the daughter of the owner of the rooming house where he is staying, is aware, she who is in love with him, and he with her. The love of a good woman may be able to provide Speedy with a clearer understanding of who he truly should be to impress, and/or get his mind focused on other things other than being everyone's best friend.",

He and his accomplice, Cojo (a little person), are hiding from the police. Alonzo views his disguise as perfect, especially since it keeps from view an unusual deformity of his left hand that would immediately give him away as the criminal the police are searching for. Nanon, the daughter of Zanzi, the circus owner, is the target in his act. Although Alonzo is in love with her, Nanon's father despises him. Malabar, the circus strong man, is attracted to Nanon but she is repulsed by his uninhibited sexual advances and desire to touch and hold her. Her phobia extends to the touch of any man's hand. Alonzo feeds her fears in the hopes that Nanon will fall in love with him since he is \"armless.\" Because Zanzi discovers Alonzo really has arms, Alonzo kills him, but Nanon witnesses the killing without seeing Alonzo's face; however, she does see the telltale deformity of his left hand. As Alonzo continues to plot to steal Nanon away from Mirabar, Cojo makes him realize that she will hate him once she discovers he has arms---and the deformity showing that he is her father's murderer. Alonzo decides to have both his arms amputated, which he succeeds in doing through blackmailing a surgeon. While Alonzo is away recuperating from the surgery, Nanon gets over her fear of being touched and falls completely in love with Mirabar. Discovering this upon his return, Alonzo hatches a scheme to kill Mirabar as he attempts his latest, most dangerous stunt.",

The film follows a group of German schoolboys, talked into enlisting at the beginning of World War 1 by their jingoistic teacher. The story is told entirely through the experiences of the young German recruits and highlights the tragedy of war through the eyes of individuals. As the boys witness death and mutilation all around them, any preconceptions about \"the enemy\" and the \"rights and wrongs\" of the conflict disappear, leaving them angry and bewildered. This is highlighted in the scene where Paul mortally wounds a French soldier and then weeps bitterly as he fights to save his life while trapped in a shell crater with the body. The film is not about heroism but about drudgery and futility and the gulf between the concept of war and the actuality.",

The Spanish crew had the advantage of watching the dailies from the English crew's version when they came in for the evening and they would figure out better camera angles and more effective use of lighting in an attempt to \"top\" it. As a result, this version's supporters consider it to be much more artistically effective.",

Unknown even to himself, a blind beggar, who sold the murderer a balloon for one of the child victims, may have key information as to the murderer's identity. The murder squad's work is made even more difficult with the large number of tips they receive from the paranoid public, who are quick to accuse anyone of suspicious activity solely for their own piece of mind that someone - anyone - is apprehended for the heinous crimes. Conversely, many want to take the case into their own hands, including the town's leading criminals since the increased police presence has placed a strain on their ability to conduct criminal activity. Although they both have the same end goal of capturing the murderer, the police and the criminals seem to be working at cross purposes, which may provide an edge to the murderer in getting away.",

    "plot": "Dr. Fred V. Kammacher, a young physician living a short distance from Berlin, has been disappointed in his bacteriological researches and to add to his mental and physical distress, his wife, Angele, develops symptoms of brain derangement. The couple are the fond parents of three children and when Dr. Rasmussen, the family physician advises that Angele be taken to a sanatorium, Kammacher is threatened with a general breakdown. He reluctantly consents to the pleadings of his mother to seek rest away from his home and makes his first sojourn in Berlin. While there he accepts an invitation from an old friend to attend a matinee performance, at which Miss Ingegerd Halstrom, a famous danseuse, appears in her latest creation, \"The Dance of the Spider.\" Kammacher falls under her charm and is introduced by her father after the performance. But he is disillusioned when he finds her bestowing her attention indiscriminately upon the gallants who surround her. He leaves in disgust and upon later receiving ill tidings from home, departs for Southampton, where he engages passage on the liner \"Roland,\" bound for America. He is seeking to forget the troubles that beset him. Through a curious twist of fate, Ingegerd and her father also have taken passage on the same steamship and Dr. Kammacher, upon the renewal of the acquaintance, finds himself more closely attracted toward the young dancer. Dr. Kammacher is sorely puzzled over the whimsical nature of Ingegerd and during one of his trouble slumbers dreams that he has landed on the island of Atlantis, the mythical realm which, according to the ancient Greeks, disappeared under the crest of the sea, only to resume its activities on the sands at the bottom of Neptune's domain. Here he meets old friends and is enjoying their greetings when a violent shock rouses him from his slumbers. In a dense fog the \"Roland\" has struck a hulk and water pours in volumes into her hold. The boiler room is flooded, but the stokers stick bravely to their posts and officers and crew exert every effort to restore calm among the passengers. Realizing that hope is fast fleeing, the captain orders the life boats lowered and in an instant pandemonium reigns on board the doomed vessel. Scantily clad passengers from the saloon scramble to the upper deck, while the panic stricken emigrants in the steerage madly trample each other in their wild frenzy to reach the boats. Fearful of delay, scores plunge into the angry ocean seeking rescue from those in pitching life boats. A watery grave is the fate of hundreds and gradually the \"Roland\" lists and sinks into the bosom of the relentless ocean. With difficulty, Dr. Kammacher rescues Ingegerd, but her father is among the victims. For many weary hours, filled with mingled hope and despair, the little group huddle together in the life boat, the men taking their turns at the oars. Toward morning the tossing craft is sighted by a cargo steamer bound for New York and Kammacher, Ingegerd and their fellow survivors are taken aboard and start again toward the New World. Sandy Hook, the Statue of Liberty and the impressive skyline of New York are vividly depicted and finally the steamship pier, where the rescued are besieged by newspaper reporters anxious to learn the particulars of the sinking of the \"Roland.\" Unthan, one of the survivors, otherwise known as \"The Armless Wonder\" is the center of a curious group while Dr. Kammacher is taken in charge by Will Snyder, an artist and an old-time friend of the young physician. Fate decrees that Ingegerd at this point drops out of the life of Dr. Kammacher. It is related that she repeats her success as a dancer and in a whirl of gayety soon forgets her fancied attachment for the man who had saved her life. From the hour of his arrival in America, the sojourn of Dr. Kammacher is varied and filled with innumerable moments of interest. Dr. Schmidt, an old friend, invites him to seek rest in his mountain cabin, standing among the snowdrifts beyond the Canadian border. He accepts, but before leaving pays his farewells to Eva Burns, a young sculptress, whom he had met during one of his rounds of the studies in company with Snyder. Fever overtakes him in his mountain retreat and almost at the same time he receives news of the death of his wife. Miss Burns nurses him back to health. The story does not end at this point and while the finale may be guessed at, the evolving of the details supplies a number of strong and appealing scenes.",

A few moments after a well-dressed stranger steps from behind the curtains and, with the coolest of sangfroid, steals the valuables in the very presence of the princess, and with a polite bow hands her his card and makes a dignified exit. Upon the card the name \"Fantomas\" slowly appears. The police are quickly upon the scene, but Fantomas, true to his nom de plume, has vanished. Inspector Robert Juve is the sleuth entrusted to track the mysterious marauder. But before Juve has time to move in the matter of the princess's jewels and cash, another escapade of Fantomas' is thrust upon him to investigate. Lord Beltham is missing. Juve calls on Lady Beltham, and in a man's hat finds the initial \"G.\" With so slight a clue Juve tracks down \"Gurn\" (none other than the elusive Fantomas) to his lodgings and makes the ghastly discovery of Lord Beltham's dead body in one of \"Gurn's\" traveling trunks, and a packet of the special Fantomas cards establishes the connection between \"Gurn\" and Fantomas; they are one and the same man. Three months elapse. \"Gurn\" has been tried and condemned to die by the guillotine. Lady Beltham's name has not yet appeared in connection with the case, and the story goes that the murder was the outcome of a violent quarrel between \"Gurn\" and Beltham, yet she is enamored of the gentlemanly scoundrel and sets about seeking a method of escape for him. By means of liberal bribes, the aid of Warden Nibet is enlisted and he arranges an interview between the condemned man and Lady Beltham in a house overlooking the prison. That night a new play has been produced by a famous actor, Valgrand, who, acting the role of a condemned felon, adds a realistic touch by making up exactly to resemble \"Gurn.\" At Lady Beltham's invitation, Valgrand, still made up as \"Gurn,\" visits her at 2 A.M., and partaking of drugged coffee, is rendered incapable of action. Warden Nibet returns and takes back his prisoner, no longer \"Gurn,\" alias Fantomas, but the unfortunate Valgrand, who goes through all the terrible preliminaries of a criminal's execution, aye, even to the point of being led to the guillotine, before inspector Juve makes the startling discovery that Fantomas has once more eluded him. Henceforth it is to be a fight between a clever, scheming, mysterious rogue on one hand, and inspector Juve, Chief of the Detective Dept. of Paris, on the other.",

    "plot": "Naturally, after his last experience, Inspector Juve winces under such rebuff as the substitution of Valgrand and the escape of Fantomas. Eventually a mysterious crime puzzles him and his assistant, Fandor. To the chief of the Criminal Investigation Department, he reports that the body of a woman, found in the house of Dr. Charles, cannot be identified. Papers bearing the name of Lady Beltham had been discovered in her clothing. Was the body that of Lady Beltham, the accomplice of Gurn, or was it the intention that people should believe that she was dead? Juve wondered why the body was found in the house of Dr. Charles. He concerns himself to watch the house, and the patience of Fandor and himself is unexpectedly rewarded. One day Dr. Charles leaves the house, and the car in which he rides is followed. Charles makes a false move. The man who leaves the closed car is not the Dr. Charles who got in. He is now a young man, with a black moustache, whereas Charles is a middle-aged man with a black beard. That is decidedly suspicions, and the detectives are in time to see him accept a note from a woman who is waiting for him. Instructing Fandor to follow the girl, Juve goes after the other man, known to the police as Lawrence, the leader of bandits. Following Lawrence (alias Charles) in a taxi, he is fated to lose his quarry, as an accomplice of the bandit punctures the tire of one of the wheels, and Juve is stranded in a street while Lawrence gets clear away. So far there is nothing to connect Charles, alias Lawrence, with Fantomas, alias Gurn. Fandor fares much better. The girl does not succeed in throwing the younger detective off the track and is apparently unconscious of the fact that she is being followed until she notices Fandor in the same compartment of the railway carriage in which she is traveling. Fandor tracks her to a house. Having seen her safely indoors, he sends a note to Juve, saying that he is keeping a good watch. Meanwhile, Lawrence has rend the note Josephine handed him, and he learns that an elderly man, confidential clerk in the employment of Messrs, Brown and Co., has fallen in love with her. That afternoon he is taking $30,000 to clients of the firm, and thinking that she is attached to him, wishes to take her with him on the journey. They were leaving the Gare de Lyon Station for Bercy by the Northern Express at three o'clock that afternoon. Would Lawrence be at the station with others of the gang? In consequence of the breakdown of the car, the note which Fandor had written did not reach Juve. Fandor, however, had waited near the house of the girl, and when she left, dressed as a lady, followed her to the Gare de Lyon, where she met the confidential messenger. No doubt there was a hidden meaning in this meeting, and Fandor decided to join the train; so did Lawrence and others of the gang whom he had gathered round him. The whole party traveled in the last coach of the train, and when the time bad arrived, one of the men climbed along the footboard and uncoupled the coach. Lawrence recognized Fandor, but his presence on the train made no difference to the plans of the bandits. As the coach began to fall away from the rest of the train, Josephine left the compartment in which a peremptory demand for the money be carried, whilst Fandor was also attacked. By this time the speed of the coach has very sensibly slackened and the gang easily escaped, fleeing in a motorcar waiting for them. In the car they examined the haul, and to their intense mortification discovered that the notes the man carried were all half notes, the remainder of which were to be handed to the clients of Brown and Co. when the contract was completed. When Fandor recovered from the shock of the attack he pulled the communication cord. To his consternation he found that not only had it been severed, but that the coach was running down the decline. He knew that the Northern Express was following the train in which he had traveled, and nothing but a miracle would avert a serious disaster. The coach ran back, and as the express began to cross the bridge the engine collided with the coach and the whole train was terribly wrecked. Lawrence determines to obtain the remaining halves of the notes, but decides that before doing so Juve must be killed. With that purpose in view, he, in the name of Fandor, wires to Juve to come to the Bercy cellars of Brown and Co. the following night. Juve, taking the wire as authentic, goes to Bercy, and. seeing someone moving behind the casks, fires, and then creeps forward, to run against Fandor. Lawrence and his accomplice began firing at the detectives, the barrels of spirit were set on fire, and through a tornado of flames the detectives escape. Fantomas again himself escapes, and they lose entire trace of him until one night when at a hotel, Juve and Fandor meet Josephine, and after Juve is introduced by Fandor, he insists that Josephine divulge the whereabouts of Fantomas. She reluctantly, under the threat of arrest, takes Juve to a place where Fantomas is dining with two wealthy young ladies in the disguise of the supposed Dr. Charles. A card is sent to Fantomas saying that someone is waiting for him outside. Fantomas, believing this to be one of his gang, departs from the hotel and is immediately arrested by Juve and Fandor. After they walk down the street, Dr. Charles suddenly makes a struggle and to the amazement of Juve and Fandor, he leaves in their hands nothing but two plaster casts of his arms with his coat sleeves attached. They decide to track Lady Beltham. After much trouble they discover her to be making midnight visits to her old haunted villa. Here they make a visit in the day-time, and being satisfied that there must be still some connection between Fantomas and Lady Beltham, hide and overhear a conversation where Faniomas decides be must get rid of Juve and will send a silent executioner to destroy him. Juve does not exactly know what this silent executioner means, but he prepares to receive a serpent. He is almost crushed to death in spite of his precaution, but survives and surrounds the haunted villa of Lady Beltham. Fantomas is almost caught unprepared, but being ever ready, he quickly sets a trap in which to get together the whole of the police, including Juve and Fandor, so that he may destroy them all by dynamite. These easily fall into the trap, so quickly but well laid. Fantomas realizes that his opportunity has come, and leaping from a cistern in which he had been hiding, he touches the coil of wire and explodes the dynamite cartridge, blowing the haunted villa to a heap of ruins, together with the occupants. The question still remains unsolved: Are Juve and Fandor still alive?",

    "plot": "Balduin, a student of Prague, leaves his roystering companions in the beer garden, when he finds he has reached the end of his resources. He is scarcely seated in a quiet corner when a hideous, shriveled-up old man taps him upon the shoulder and whispers vaguely of a big inheritance for Prague's finest swordsman and wildest student if he will enter into a certain agreement. Balduin rebuffs him, satirically asking his weird companion to procure him \"the luckiest ticket in a lottery or a doweried wife.\" The old man goes off chuckling and thence onward persistently shadows Balduin, exerting a sinister influence over him, while Balduin is still disconsolate under the frowns of fortune. The Countess Margit Schwarzenberg, hunting with her cousin, to whom her father has betrothed her, meets with an accident. She is thrown over her horse's head into a river, but Balduin, who has been directed to the spot by his evil genius, plunges in and rescues her. Subsequently Balduin calls to inquire as to her condition at the castle of her father, the count, but be makes a hurried departure when Baron Waldis arrives, the contrast in their appearance discrediting him. His desire to win the countess and to humiliate the baron becomes so pronounced that he readily accedes to the compact suggested by Scapinelli, the old man, who has so pertinaciously dogged his footsteps, particularly when he learns that untold wealth and power will be his when he assigns to the other the right to take from his room whatever he chooses for his own use as he desires. The agreement is signed. Balduin receives a shower of gold and notes as his portion; Scapinelli takes Balduin's soul exposed in concrete form by his shadow. Balduin prosecutes his love affair assiduously and with apparent success, till the baron is informed of it by a jealous gypsy girl. He challenges Balduin to a duel, and the latter, assured of his superiority as a fencer, readily agrees. Count Schwarzenberg learns of the impending duel and appeals to Balduin not to kill \"my sister's child, my daughter's future husband, and my heir.\" Balduin gives his promise, but when he goes to the venue of the duel he meets, his own counterpart stalking away derisively wiping his gory sword on his cloak. Balduin turns and in the far distance sees the dying victim of the deed he swore he would not do. He rushes from the spot horror-stricken. When he regains sufficient composure he makes his way to the castle of the count, but is refused admission. Determined to explain that he had no complicity in the death of the baron, Balduin climbs into a room in which the countess is seated. She receives him coldly, but soon succumbs to his ardent wooing. Just as he seeks to leave her she notices he has no shadow and that the mirror gives no reflection of him; and she drops back affrighted, the ghastly apparition of himself which takes shape in the corner of the room sends Balduin scuttling away from the castle in a paroxysm of terror. He makes a frenzied flight through a woodland estate and the streets of Prague, but wherever he stops to recover his breath he is haunted by the counterpart of himself. He reaches his rooms and draws a murderous looking fire-arm from its case. As the phantasmagorical figure strides towards him with a sinister grin, he fires, and in a few minutes the blood gushes from his own side from a fatal wound.",

The villain escapes from prison and makes his way to the railroad station and boards a train where he is tracked by private detectives. When the train stops at a country station, Fantomas alights with the intention of making good his escape, but he finds that he is being followed by two detectives, whom he recognizes. He goes back to his carriage, which leads the detectives to think he is quite safe, but he crosses the train and leaves by the opposite door, jumping into the baggage wagon of the train on the opposite rail. Just at that moment the train moves and a magistrate who happens to have nearly missed the train also jumps into the baggage wagon. Fantomas was who hiding, attacks the magistrate, and after a severe struggle in which he is victorious assumes the disguise of the magistrate and takes his clothes and papers. He continues the journey as the magistrate, successfully rescues certain criminals, who are brought before him to be tried, and manages to blackmail several members of society, with whom he is brought in contact. While here he is recognized by Fandor, the young and clever journalist who happens to come into the district and who has suspicions as to the authenticity of the magistrate. He decides to keep watch upon him. His suspicions are well founded and he identifies the magistrate as none other than Fantomas. After much trouble, he is able to get papers committing Fantomas to prison, but Fantomas' suspecting his immediate arrest, issues an order to the head warden, and tells him that it is Detective Juve's intention to be arrested disguised as Fantomas. The warden is not to tell a soul of the detective's intentional disguise, but is to let him remain in prison until 12 o'clock midnight, when the head warden is to personally release him. The police, not suspecting anything of this, feel quite safe when Fantomas is put in the cell and securely barred and locked. His scheme works favorably and once more Fantomas is at large.",

Count Spinelli is the secret agent of the foreign power, and it is his mission to find out what the plans of the government are. To assist in attaining his end, the count organizes a carrier pigeon service between his government's headquarters and an old mill on his own estate. Upon war being declared, Rear-Admiral Van Houven arranges his order of attack, and hands over the sealed orders referring to same, to his son, Lieutenant Van Houven. Through an extremely tragic train of events, these sealed orders are placed in the way of Spinelli, who, of course, is not slow to take advantage of his opportunity. Accordingly he copies the orders and sends them by carrier pigeon to his own chief. The pigeon, however, is shot by a government officer; the message is discovered and Rear-Admiral Van Houven learns of the treachery. Quite naturally he immediately suspects his son, and putting duty before paternal affection orders his arrest. The son is court-martialed, found guilty and ordered to be shot. Lieutenant Van Houven's wife reads the result of the trial and makes an abortive attempt to save her husband. Now we see some of the inner workings of Fate. Count Spinelli is trapped in the old mill; round about the war is raging; deeds of heroism are being performed; Lieutenant Van Houven is taken out to be executed and his wife lies at home prostrated with grief. In the midst of a troubled sleep she has a complicated dream, and we are shown in a very graphic manner how in this dream she tries to piece together all the various tragic details of the story. Her troubled brain eventually connects up the incidents in the proper sequence, and awakening she sees a way out of the maze. Through a series of stirring scenes, the problem is rapidly brought to a satisfactory solution and the story winds up in the happy manner the public taste demands.",

Curtis had already shot footage in 1906 of the Hopi Snake dance, which he had previously showed during his talks, but this was to be on a grander scale. It took three years of preparation for this one film including the weaving of the costumes; building of the war canoes, housefronts, poles; and the carving of masks. Assisting on the film was George Hunt, a Kwakwaka'wakw who had served as an interpreter for the famous anthropologist Franz Boas nearly twenty years before. Hunt helped contribute substantial portions of the film's story as well. Selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, this early Native American drama/documentary released in 1914 is an amazing film produced in collaboration with the tribe members. The story of love and revenge among the Kwakwaka'wakw of British Columbia, Motana, the son of a great chief, goes on a vigil journey. Through fasting and hardships he hopes to gain supernatural strength which will make him a chief as powerful as his father. Curtis showcases the Kwakwaka'wakw's magnifcent war canoes, totem poles, rituals, costumes and dancing.",

    "title": "Judith of Bethulia",
    "year": 1914,
    "genres": [
      "Drama"
    ],
    "plot": "A fascinating work of high artistry, \"Judith of Bethulia\" will not only rank as an achievement in this country, but will make foreign producers sit up and take notice. It has a signal and imperative message, and the technique displayed throughout an infinity of detail, embracing even the delicate film tinting and toning, marks an encouraging step in the development of the new art. Ancient in story and settings, it is modern in penetrative interpretation - it is a vivid history of one phase of the time it concerns, and is redemptive as well as relative, a lesson from one of those vital struggles that made and unmade nations as well as individuals, yet it is not without that inspiring influence that appeals powerfully to human sense of justice. The entire vigorous action of the play works up to the personal sacrifice of Judith of Bethulia, a perilous chance she takes for the sake of the lives and happiness of her people. She dares expose herself to overwhelming humiliation and dishonor in a challenge of beauty to strength, struggles through a conversion of sentiment that makes the high crisis more acute, and sets at defiance the \"better-death-than-dishonor\" platitude, escaping both through that all-conquering combination in a woman, great physical beauty joined to lofty intelligence. She enters upon a relation of constant peril - only delicate treatment saves the situation at times - abandons her native purity of conduct and dares her own undoing, yet the noble end justified the dangerous means, and she emerges idealized by her people, an apotheosis of splendid womanhood. Bethulia is a fortified town of Judea, guarding a hill pass through which an invading Assyrian army must march in order to enter Judea. In the town lives Judith, a devout young woman of lofty character and remarkable beauty, when the place is stormed by Holofernes at the head of a large army. The fighting before the gate brings into action an enormous number of soldiers on both sides, and those engines of war, such as the battering ram and catapult, which were used by the fighting male of other days under close condition of furious combat. One desperate assault after another is repelled, scaling ladders are thrown down, great rocks are showered upon the invaders, and the wonder is that they keep at it. The reason is that Holofernes has a way of torturing and killing unsuccessful captains. As officer had better die in the thick of battle than return with a confession of defeat. Holofernes is as merciless as nature to all who fail. The great leader's brutality of his captains when they do not succeed in carrying the fortress by storm indicates what the inhabitants of Bethulia may expect in the event of capture and serves to intensify the clash of character later on - it adds peril to the undertaking of Judith when she resolves to sacrifice herself for her people. Holofernes, after making a horrible example of defeated captains by frightful torture, resorts to strategy. His soldiers have seized the wells from which the inhabitants of Bethulia obtained their water supply, and their leader adopts waiting tactics, diverting himself with dancing girls to break the tedium. Bethulia is on the verge of famine, and the besieged are almost ready to surrender the fortress and all Judea to the spoilers, when Judith goes forth in her finest raiment, accompanied only by her maid, enters the Assryian camp and obtains an interview with the merciless Holofernes. Against his formidable strength, his brutal ferocity and cunning, his absolute power, are matched her fascinating personality directed by intelligence and hidden purpose. She is willing to carry \"her fault on her shoulders like a coronation mantle.\" The dangerous and difficult situation from this point to Judith's terrible triumph and the defeat of the invading Assyrians is pictured without loss of force or charm by extreme delicacy of treatment. Beauty is constantly asserted by almost reckless prodigality in the matter of costume, and by the appeal of delightful acting. The feminine sweetness and shyness of the lovely Judith are intensified by her advances and retreats in measuring her sex attractions against his formidable power. She is weakened at the critical moment by a sudden flame of passion and compassion aroused in her breast, but self-control returns at a thought of all that is at stake, the safety and happiness of thousands of her people, and she dares be all and do all that revolts her finer nature from a deep hatred of injustice and wrong meted out to her peace-loving kindred and friends, from a noble desire to preserve her country and the destinies of her race.",

Typical of extravagant D'Annunzian aestheticism at its height, Rapsodia Satanica was one of the summits of what was later called the \"tail coat film.\" Diametrically opposed to the \"cinema of reality\" practiced by Serena, Martoglio and others, \"tail coat films\" set their melodramatic stories in the salons and villas of the upper middle class and the aristocracy, deploying narrative structures contrived to showcase their actors and especially its actresses. This had the effect of accentuating their physical presence and turning them into stars - probably the first stars in movie history. The success of the \"diva\" contributed to the development of motion picture grammar in its special use of the close-up.",

    "plot": "Roy Somerville has turned out a rather interesting story that will hold the interest of the majority of audiences as produced by the Triangle-Fine Arts Company. It is a five-reel feature and was produced under the direction of C.M. and S.S. Franklin, with Norma Talmadge as the star. Cora (Norma Talmadge) is wedded to Arthur Vincent (Eugene Pallette) and there are two children. Vincent is the son of the president of a bank and is devoting the greater part of his time to Jane Courtenay, a cabaret dancer, who is willing to have him devote his time to her as long as he is a good provider. The wife, who has been sadly neglected, turns to her sister, who is wedded to Fred Brown, a young detective. His brother Charles, who works in the elder Vincent's bank as a cashier, lives with them. He was Cora's first love and has never quite recovered from the fact that she jilted him to wed Vincent because of his money. The cabaret dancer makes several demands on the young Vincent, who tries to borrow money from his father to meet them; failing to receive the loan he agrees to aid several friends of the cabaret charmer to rob his father's bank. After the robbery Charles Brown is accused of the crime and arrested. But the robbers are discovered in their hiding place, and in escaping all but one is killed. Cora is left a widow and the natural supposition is that she and Charles were happily married afterward. Just where the title comes in is hard to say, but the picture while not one of the best that has been produced at the Fine Arts, is one that will get by because it will particularly appeal to women.",

Briggs recognizes Remington as his former partner in crime, Higgins. Remington and his wife, Grace, used to work with Briggs in many house robberies, although for the last Remington and Briggs served time in prison. When they were released Remington found that Grace had borne him a baby, and for the baby's sake, determined to live straight. Briggs blackmails Remington until he has no more money to give him. Then he demands that Remington aid him in one more big deal, or he will expose Grace for her complicity in by-gone crimes, and have her sent to prison to do her \"bit.\" Remington loves his wife, and for her sake, although without her knowledge, he agrees. Unaware of his danger, Grace has gone to spend the weekend at the home of a wealthy friend, the very place, it so happens, that Briggs has selected to burgle. In due course Remington and Briggs jimmy open the library window and enter. The former tackles the safe in his old dexterous manner, and Briggs goes upstairs to see what loose jewelry he may \"lift\" from bureaus and the like. Briggs happens to enter the room where Grace is asleep in bed. She hears him and awakens. She attacks the intruder, and a desperate struggle takes place. Meanwhile, Remington has completed his job at the safe and follows Briggs upstairs. Seeing him struggling with his wife, he knocks Briggs to the floor unconscious. Of course, this has aroused the other guests, and as they throng into the hall Remington's escape has been cut off. Grace's quick wit saves the situation. She plants her husband's mask, gun and jimmy on the unconscious Briggs and tells the guests that her husband followed her to the place in time to save her from a desperate burglar, the injured man lying on the floor. Unfortunately, Briggs escapes in the excitement, and his desire to be revenged on who the man has double-crossed him leads to a smashing finish.",

Things have not gone any too well with him, but he sends for his daughter Gretchen to come and join him. In the tenement to which Gretchen goes to make her home is Pietro, a young Italian immigrant who is fast making his way in the new world and who finds Gretchen the inspiration to strive for the best and finest things in the world. Gretchen smiles not unkindly on Pietro. There comes among the good people of the tenement Rodgers, a thoroughly bad man who sees in the old Dutch engraver a tool whereby he can better do his evil work. He works on Van Houck's pride in his skill as an engraver, until the old man one day makes a plate from which Rodgers and his gang are able to print counterfeit bills so well that they defy detection. When the old man learns to what use his engraving is put and, what is far worse, discovers that Gretchen is being made an innocent tool to pass the spurious money, he determines to expose the gang. To frustrate him, he is kidnapped and thrown aboard a vessel. Gretchen is also taken captive and Rodgers, who has long had his eye upon the little Dutch girl, seems more than likely to accomplish his evil intentions towards her. The Garrity kids, however, have to be reckoned with. From the day Gretchen appeared at the tenement, they became her best friends. When they saw her rush off, evidently in great trouble, one of them followed and when he saw his beloved Gretchen being carried aboard the boat he rushed off to give the alarm. Pietro was the first one he sought. The alarm was given and a desperate chase after the boat followed. The fast motorboat overhauled the fugitive and after a real fight, the counterfeiters were captured and the old Dutchman and Gretchen were rescued. The final scene disclosed old John Van Houck hurling the hated engraving and all the counterfeit money overboard.",

Holmes then goes to Watson's house, where he sends a note for the woman who holds the papers to meet him there. His cab driver, who is waiting outside, is the leader of the band of crooks.

At home her mother takes in washing to help support three smaller children and a lazy, beer-drinking, novel-reading, good-for-nothing husband and father. For months Eva has needed a pair of shoes. As the weeks pass the necessity for shoes increases, until finally heavy rains set in and rot what little there is left of her bedraggled and worthless shoes, until they are literally falling from her feet. Eva brings her unopened pay envelope home to her mother every Saturday night, to be, each time, promised that \"next week\" she should have the money for a pair of shoes. She has set her heart upon a pair that are displayed in a shop window she passes going to and from her work. But each week there is a new and valid reason for postponement; the rent must be paid, the merchants will no longer trust them for food, and the worthless father is still out of work. And all this time she sees the money she has earned go for beer, dime novels and food to satisfy her shiftless parent's desires. Finally, one Saturday night, she demands of her father that he shall provide her with a pair of shoes. Her only solace is the retort from the man who was her natural protector and supporter that he also needed shoes for himself. Then and there Eva resolves that she shall no longer suffer from sore feet, blistered and splintered from the rough floor upon which she stands behind the counter. One of her fellow-slaves in the five and ten-cent store has introduced her to a cabaret singer, weeks before, but she had steadfastly and indifferently declined his invitations to be entertained. Eva repairs to her cheerless room in the dreary and stuffy flat; she puts on a clean shirt-waist, lowers her skirt by pinning it around her hips so that her rotten and ragged shoes are hidden, gets carfare from her mother and says she is going to spend Sunday with her girl friend from the store. And Monday night Eva returns home from work with the new shoes upon her feet.",

    "plot": "Mayme is a beautiful young woman who is forced to earn her own living. Her beauty proves a serious handicap in that it attracts the attention of every man who is forced to come in contact with her, the result being that she is forced to resign from place to place in order to escape from their attentions. Finally, in desperation, she sees an advertisement for a social secretary and answers it. Before doing so she disguises her comeliness as much as possible. She is accepted for the position by the society matron who has inserted the advertisement. In the household there is a young son, who is a most estimable young man with but one fault, drink. There is also a daughter, a foolish young thing, who believes her cup of happiness would be filled to overflowing were she able to announce her marriage to a titled person. One night, the some coming home late after a spree, climbs into the window and comes unexpectedly on the social secretary, who, believing herself safe from prying eyes, is satisfying a natural feminine desire to make herself look as pretty as possible. The son is astounded, and attempts to embrace her. The young woman escapes however. The following morning the social secretary announces that she is going to resign, but the son, seeing her alone, begs her to remain, and promises that he will never offend again. She does so, and shortly afterwards meets a count who is paying court to the young daughter of the household. The secretary recognizes him as one of the men with whom she had an ugly experience in former years, but realizes that her word would not be taken at that time, as against the count's, who has completely won the girl. The secretary determines to thwart the count, however, and permits him to flirt with her again. He makes an appointment to meet her in the garden, and she keeps it, first making certain that they will be discovered by the family. They are, and the engagement is broken by the girl's mother. The count is persistent, however, and telephones the girl to meet him at his apartment. The secretary overhears the telephone conversation by \"listening in\" on another wire and determines to prevent the meeting, or at least to protect the girl. A reporter who has observed the meetings of the count, the girl and the secretary and the young son of the family, anxious to secure a story for his paper, takes to following the various members of the family, and in this manner trails the girl to the count's apartment. The secretary also having anonymously warned the girl's mother of the meeting, hurries off to the apartment and climbs the fire escape to effect an entrance unobserved. When the girl has been in the apartment but a few minutes, her mother and the reporter seek admittance. The girl, in a panic, is thrust in a rear room by the count. The secretary is on the fire escape outside this room, and when she is certain the girl is alone, opens the window and urges her to flee by means of the fire escape. The girl does so, and the secretary takes her place in the room, but as the enraged mother, her son, and the reporter rush into the room, the astonishment of the count is as real as that of the others in the room when he sees who is really there. The mother is naturally indignant that a person who would be found in so compromising a position would dare enter her home. The son is the soul of loyalty, however, and sticks to the girl whom he wants to marry, even in the face of the incriminating circumstances. When it seems certain that the girl must stand convicted of whatever people choose to think of her, the young daughter comes to her rescue and confesses that she was in the room, and that she had been able to escape only through the generosity of the social secretary. Vindicated, the social secretary rewards the young man for his loyalty by accepting his love and giving him her promise to be his wife.",

After Trent is captured, Joan is brought to the attention of the beleaguered Dauphin, heir to the French throne, who cannot be crowned because the English hold the royal city of Orleans. The weak Dauphin is impressed by her vision and apparently heaven-sent powers which border on the supernatural and ultimately gives her command of the armies. She is victorious at Orleans and the new King is crowned. Joan resists Trent's entreaties of love and continues her struggle to free the rest of her country from English occupation. Sinister forces, both English and French, conspire against her and she is captured. Tortured and condemned, she dies at the stake but never loses her faith and vision.",

When Lawrence's sister dies, her daughter spends the little money she has to journey to California and live with her uncle. Arriving at the isolated cabin, she realizes he is an impostor, but his threats intimidate her into silence. Lacking money and protection, she immediately becomes vulnerable to the advances of the largely all-male population, and so must acknowledge Brown publicly as her uncle in order to continue to receive food, shelter, and his protection. Over time, this understanding of mutual convenience turns to affection, and he pledges to reform. When former members of his gang continue their dishonest ways, however, the now rehabilitated Brown falls under the suspicion of the local vigilante committee.",

In this case, however, it was the young wife whose numerous clubs called her frequently from her fireside, affording gossip for the neighbors. However, unmindful of the discussion of their affairs, Tillie continued to cook dainty dishes for her unappreciative husband, while Luella Pipkin found fault with everything her meek husband did to please her. For several weeks it happened that Tinkelpaw and Luella would accidentally meet at the door, and naturally would walk down the street together. However, on one occasion where Mr. Tinkelpaw had been less appreciative than usual, and departed leaving Tillie in tears, she went to the window, hoping he might relent and throw her a kiss. At the same time Luella was out of sorts on account of having lost at bridge, and when she left, Pipkin also went to the window to see if she had really gone. What they saw affected them like a cold plunge. Both of them wrote to their faithless mates informing them that all was over; and on starting out into the world met in the hallway. Each recognized in the other a kindred soul; so linking arms, they set forth. On Luella's return she found the note, and frantically started in search of her husband. Tinkelpaw had also found a similar communication; so together they left in search of the truants. After following a devious trail they came upon them as they were attempting to use a photographer's automobile as an ocean liner. As the bedraggled Tillie is enfolded in her repentant husband's arms she winks slyly at Pipkin who is being fondled by a much chastened Luella.",

However, the War had hit Europe, and the Turks had informed the American ambassador, Henry Morganthau, in Constantinople, that the Armenians were giving support to the Turks' enemy, Russia. Despite Morgantheau's objections, the Turks issue a decree that the Armenians must be moved southward into the desert. The Turkish governor, a Pasha, comes to Aurora's father and demands she be given him as a bride. The father tells him his daughter will not give up her Christian belief, as she would have to do to marry a Muslim. The governor leaves in anger. The order is given for the removal of the Armenians. The men are separated from the women, and the Armenian soldiers are forced to disrobe and dig a trench, and then are shot down by the Turks. Mothers are torn away from their children and the Armenians are marched away into the desert where, famine, thirst and fierce heat await them. Aurora escapes to a mission school ran by Edith Graham, an English girl. The Turk soldiers surround the school and Miss Graham protests under the protection of the English flag to no avail,as the Turks trample the flag, and the Armenian girls are dragged away. Miss Graham, determined to help the girls as much as she possibly can, disguises herself as one of them and joins the march.",

Griffith's epic Intolerance, Denmark's greatest director, Carl Theodor Dreyer (The Passion of Joan of Arc, Vampyr), was inspired to make his own four-episode historical epic with each story told end to end, anthology-style, linked by theme to the others. The unifying character, Satan, attempts to win God's favor but is doomed to cheerless participation in dark episodes of human history: the temptation of Jesus, the Spanish Inquisition, the French Revolution and the Russo-Finnish war of 1918. Few directors resisted compromise and convention the way Dreyer did; fortunately, the Nordisk Film Company was artistically progressive by Hollywood standards and agreed that this should be a prestige film made to the highest standards. More than two years in production, Dreyer not only directed but also controlled every facet of this ambitious production.",

Despite this, Bim is a kind-hearted soul, and that becomes very apparent when he rescues a young runaway from a beating by a railroad cop at the expense of being beaten himself. Young Bill reciprocates Bim's kindness and has to endure taunting and abuse from the school bully to defend his 'pal.' Bim wants Bill to rise above his station and encourages him to bathe and attend the town's modest one-room schoolhouse presided over by pretty schoolmarm Mary Bruce. She is being courted by the outwardly respectable bank clerk Harvey Cahill, who has embezzled funds from his employer and ungallantly presses the kind-hearted Mary into lending him the school memorial fund money she is entrusted with to cover the shortfall for the bank examiner. Things become complicated when the devious town doctor and his conniving wife discover that Bill may be a missing heir and unscrupulously conspire to wrest custody from Bim in order to claim the substantial reward themselves. The devious Cahill enters into league with a gang of bandits to rob the bank in order to cover the shortfall and blames his romantic rival Bim for the crime.",

Disheartened, she returns to Piney Woods to help a reverend running a school for young negroes.

When she saves a child from being hit by an auto, she herself is slightly injured. But the owner of the car is philanthropist Mrs. Elena Warwick, who is sympathetic to her quest and promises to donate the $5,000 to the school. Her bigoted southern friend, Mrs. Stratton, tries to talk her out of the donation, and Mrs. Warwick gets so incensed she raises the amount to $50,000. Her job done, Sylvia returns to Piney Woods.

Queen Gertrude is here presented as conspiring in her first husband's murder, and the old king's ghost does not appear - young Hamlet merely hears a voice from the tomb and (apparently) dreams of him. In addition, Hamlet now kills Claudius (in a fire) immediately upon returning from Norway with an army led by old school- friend Fortinbras, and it falls to Gertrude to engineer Hamlet's death in the fencing match as well as kill herself by accidentally drinking the poisoned wine.",

    "plot": "Upon the death of his father the King, Rudolph V is set to assume the throne of Ruritania. Both he and his half-brother, Grand Duke Michael, love Princess Flavia, their orphaned cousin who lives in a wing of the palace located in the Ruritanian capital of Strelsau. While half the populace favor the King and the other half the Grand Duke, the entire populace loves Flavia. She is attracted to the Grand Duke's magnetism, but she, in a sense of obligation to her country to support his reign, believes that she will marry the King despite she not being in love with him due to he indulging excessively in his vices, such as the drink, and thus often acting irresponsibly and not in the manner of a king. The Grand Duke, with his longtime faithful companions De Gautet, Bersonin, Detchard, and Rupert of Hentzau, plan to detain the King at the Grand Duke's hunting lodge on the grounds of his castle at Zenda on the day of the coronation so that Michael can assume the throne in Strelsau in his place. Complicating this plan is the arrival into Ruritania of British gentry Rudolf Rassendyll the day before the coronation, he having been fascinated with everything Ruritanian ever since he learned of the purported blood connection between the English Rassendylls and the Ruritanian royal family, the Elphbergs. The complicating factor is that Rassendyll bears a striking resemblance to the King. Upon meeting Rassendyll, two of the King's faithful aides, Colonel Zapt and Captain Fritz von Tarlenheim, ask him, due to the extenuating circumstances, to impersonate the King at the coronation, to which Rassendyll reluctantly agrees. Further complicating the situation is that Rassendyll, as the King, falls immediately in love with Flavia, who in turns falls in love with the new man she believes the King has transformed into. Beyond the dangers posed to the King by the Grand Duke and his men, Rassendyll's life, by association is also in danger, especially if the Grand Duke discovers the switched identities. The wild card in this maze is Parisienne Antoinette de Mauban, also in Ruritania for the coronation, she who personally knows Rassendyll, who is love with the Grand Duke herself but does not know of his want to marry Flavia, and who is the unrequited object of affection of Rupert.",

He'd been an enormous star in early silent cinema, influencing the style of such subsequent silent comedy luminaries as Charles Chaplin and Buster Keaton. But his health suffered after he was gassed fighting for France in World War I. Despite the support of Chaplin himself (among others), his subsequent career in America never reached the popular heights he had at home. The commercial failure of this final U.S. effort seems particularly bewildering now, since THE THREE MUST-GET-THERES holds up so well. This spoof has the antic star as Dart-in-Again, a rapier-wielding dandy with a lovelorn horse (pining for the cow it left behind in the country) and a tendency to make an idiot of himself whilst attempting to conquer the forces of tyranny. Making scant effort to hide its incongruous modern Southern California backdrops, the movie is full of gags both slapstick and absurdist. Critics gratefully received it at the time. Audiences? Not so much. - Dennis Harvey",

To help convince herself to stay with her husband, she invites Arnold's mother, Lady Catherine (Eugenie Besserer), who left Arnold's father for Lord Porteous (George Fawcett).

In daytime she is supported by an old woman called Mads, who was Victors' nanny when he was a child. Mads is filled with loathing for Victor's behavior towards his wife, and calls him a brute. She understands that Ida is on the verge of a serious breakdown, and persuades Ida's mother, Mrs. Kryer, to take Ida away. Mads will herself take care of the household and the children for a time. When Victor comes home and finds out that Ida is gone, he gets angry. He asks his daughter, Karen, where her mother is, but she refuses to tell him. She only says that her mother is very ill, and that it will be his fault if she dies. The accusation strikes Victor in his heart, and he sits down, feeling dejected. Karen consoles him, and tells him where her mother is. When Victor arrives at Mrs. Kryer's apartment, looking for his wife, the visiting doctor won't let him in. The doctor tells Victor that Ida has to take a complete rest in the countryside to get well. Victor returns home, broken-hearted, and is now willing to submit himself to Mads' new regime.

The girls' lives come together as young women at eighteen as Florence leaves the security of the exclusive Girls Select School, and Molly, now orphaned, begins her life free from reform school. Norma Shearer plays both young women, but the apparent differences in their worldliness will also make them most unfamiliar in appearance. Molly's new world consists of nights at Kelly's Dance Hall and her ever-present worshiper, Chunky Dunn. On one of her nightly dance hall outing's Molly meets David Page, an up and coming inventor, whom she quickly falls in love with. Molly persuades David to seek an honest buyer for his new safe-cracking device; against the advice of Chunky whose shadier side see's this as an opportunity for himself, and to corrupt David in the process. Following Molly's advice, David meets with a group of investors, including the now retired Judge Banning, father of Florence. While at the Judges' home, David meets Florence and is instantly engaged by her charm and innocence, a characteristic not so present in Molly, although she tries hard to become such. We then begin to watch the personal struggles of two young women, both in love with David, yet both willing to give him up; Florence thinking the other has a stronger claim and Molly believing she is not good enough. Through strong direction and subtle acting intermixed with false bravado, we see Molly mature into one who sacrifices all for the sake of others, and become the person she so often imitated. -- Very sentimental - Excellent movie for the person who believes there is no good silent film.",

On his way, he is fatally hit by a descending swallow. The film is divided into three segments each of which consists of events the woman experienced. These sequences are embedded in scenes in which each of the three women is telling and casting her mind back to her own love affair. Thus, present, future and past merge and cannot be distinguished clearly. The intertwinement of several layers of time experience, recollection, telling and showing have been regarded as a source of inspiration of Alain Resnais and this film prefigures his \"L'Année dernière à Mariënbad\" to a certain extent.",

Five years later, the abandoned Balfour house comes to life again with the arrival of two sinister-looking tenants: a fiendish-looking man with pointed teeth, bulging eyes and a tall beaver hat, and a pale young woman in a long gown. The presence of the strangers prompts Sir James, who lives next door, to call in Inspector Burke again. Also living in the Hamlin household are the other people who were also present in Balfour's house the night he died: Sir James' nephew, Arthur Hibbs; the late Balfour's now-grown daughter, Lucille; and Williams, the butler. Burke expresses skepticism about Sir James' suspicions that the new neighbors might have been involved in Balfour's death, until strange things start happening: Balfour's body disappears from its tomb. The new maid, Smithson, tells a terrifying tale of being menaced in Lucille's bedroom by the stranger in the beaver hat. And a man spotted inside the Balfour house by Burke and Sir James looks distinctly like the late Roger Balfour. A skittish Arthur becomes convinced the neighbors are vampires. Burke takes Lucille aside, and tells her he doesn't believe her father committed suicide. He asks her to trust him. Burke also has a private talk with Arthur. Burke uses hypnosis to put Arthur into a trance, but learns nothing new about Balfour's death. That night, someone fires a shot into Arthur's room, but Arthur isn't there; instead, it's Burke who's slightly wounded. Lucille is abducted by the beaver-hatted man and the butler and brought to her former home. Sir James, acting at Burke's instruction, also shows up at the Balfour house; he's met out front by the beaver-hatted man, who puts him into a hypnotic trance. Arthur breaks into the Balfour house in an attempt to rescue Lucille; he's caught by Burke and a couple of detectives and locked away. It turns out the man with the beaver hat and pointed teeth was really a disguised Inspector Burke, who was aided at times by a double; Smithson, the maid, is an assistant detective; the mysterious young woman, a stage performer working for the police. Under Burke's hypnosis, Sir James re-creates his actions the night Roger Balfour died, with Lucille and the butler, Williams, playing themselves, and Burke's double playing the part of Balfour. It turns out Sir James shot and killed Balfour and made the death appear a suicide after Balfour rejected Sir James as a future husband for young Lucille. Sir James is brought out of his trance and arrested by Burke. The mystery of Balfour's death solved, Lucille and Arthur, who have come to realize how much they love each other, are now free to marry.",

    "plot": "William Haines stars as Jim Kelly, the Yankees' ace pitcher (who is also able to knock 'em out of the park?talk about versatile!) in this enjoyable baseball comedy from MGM. The picture was a tremendous hit for Haines, who made a career out of playing cocky, wise-cracking young athletic types whose large egos threaten to stand in the way of success until an attitude adjustment integrates them back into the fold. Other Haines pictures in this mold include BROWN OF HARVARD, TELL IT TO THE MARINES, and WEST POINT. In SLIDE, KELLY, SLIDE Haines does some of his finest work, mugging excessively when in prankster mode, but also surprisingly subtle in the quieter, more reflective moments. He gives Kelly the kind of real human qualities that make us like him, laugh at him, get annoyed at him, and of course, ultimately root for him.Haines is also surrounded by a top-notch supporting cast, all of whom make important contributions to the picture: Karl Dane as the lovable oaf, Sally O'Neil as the tomboyish object of Kelly's affections, Harry Carey as the girl's father and the Yankees' aging catcher, and Frank Coghlan, Jr. (billed as Junior Coghlan in those days) as the adorable orphan moppet who makes Kelly aspire to be a better man. These elements have all become cliché today, but watch this film with the eyes of 1927 movie-goers who thrilled to Kelly's happy-go-lucky antics even as they cheered him on in the inevitable ninth-inning climax, and you'll be swept along in its charm, too.",

    "plot": "Americans Sgt. Peter O'Gaffney and one of his soldiers, privileged \"pretty boy\" W. Daingerfield Phelps III (who is always drawing caricatures), are captured and interred at a POW camp in Northern Germany near the end of WWI. Their relationship has always been an antagonistic one based on what Phelps sees as O'Gaffney pushing him around. O'Gaffney's rank is despite being wanted by the police back home as a con man. It is because of these differences that their resulting friendship at camp is so unlikely, the friendship based on both having the nerve to attempt to escape. On a snow-covered day, they do manage to escape, in part by stealing white robes to camouflage themselves against the snow. In their adventures and misadventures on the outside in trying to get to safety, those adventures which include being mistaken for Arab prisoners, they find themselves as stowaways on board a cargo ship headed to Arabia. It is there that they meet a beautiful Arab woman named Mirza, who they save from drowning. They are both immediately smitten by her, which is why they are so disappointed to learn that she is betrothed in an arranged marriage to the ruthless Shevket Ben Ali. As the two try to reach the safety of an American consulate, they also decide to try and liberate Mirza, which may be more dangerous than fighting in the trenches in the battlefields of France.",

Joel has had a long friendship with the Crowninshield's daughter, Priscilla Crowninshield, that friendship which is now on the brink of romantic love as they become of age, although this new-found love is unspoken on both sides. Joel hopes that when his eldest brother, Mark Shore, captain of the Nathan Ross, returns home from his latest voyage, he will allow Joel to sail with him. Although Mark still sees Joel as the \"youngin'\" of the family, Joel, through slightly underhanded means, is able to convince Mark that he is man enough to become a sailor. Also on this layover at home, Mark notices that Priscilla has become a beautiful young woman, who he now wants to marry. Mark arranges the engagement with his father and Priscilla's father without Priscilla's knowledge. The public announcement of the engagement shocks both Joel and Priscilla, the latter who has no romantic interest in Mark. On the Nathan Ross' first sailing following the engagement, that sailing to Singapore, Captain Mark makes a decision that unwittingly sets off a series of events that jeopardize both his and Joel's lives, but also tests whether in this situation family and brotherly loyalty or being with the woman you love is more important.",

Alas, keeping the secret means sending Constance, lover of D'Artagnan, off to a convent. D'Artagnan hears of this and rallies the Musketeers in a bid to rescue her. Unfortunately, Richelieu out-smarts the Musketeers and banishes them forever. Richelieu enlists D'Artagnan to look after and protect the young prince. Meanwhile, de Rochefort learns of the twins and Richelieu's plans, and kidnaps the twin, raising him in secret. Many years later, with Richelieu dead and the young prince crowned King Louis XIV, Rochefort launches his plan. The king is kidnapped, replaced with his twin, put in an iron mask so as not to be recognized, and led off to a remote castle to be held prisoner. Louis XIV is able to alert D'Artagnan, who realizes that only his friends Athos, Porthos, and Aramis can help him, so he reunites the Musketeers to derail Rochefort's nefarious plot but at a heavy toll.",

Filimonov regains his memory in 1928, ten years after the Russian Revolution. Determined to find his wife and get his job back, he goes home to Saint Petersburg only to find out that his wife has remarried and his former employer has been replaced by a factory committee. The Saint Petersburg that he used to know also does not exist anymore. Renamed Leningrad and deprived of its status as capital, the city with its monumental buildings and statues of Lenin is foreign to Filimonov as is everything else in this new world created by the 1917 Revolution. As time goes by, however, he learns to appreciate the new ways. Although he is not reunited with his wife, he regains full control of his life. At the end of the film, Filimonov breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience directly as he declares, in true Soviet propaganda fashion: \"There is still much work to be done!\"",

During a conversation in their room, John is called away to answer a wire, and the Prince steals a kiss in his absence, for which she slaps him. So she is understandably upset when John accepts the Prince's invitation to stay at his plantation in Java when he promised to arrange a tiger hunt. She tries to dissuade John from going, but John says he always wanted to shoot a tiger and she is being unreasonable. Once at the plantation, John is too busy to pay much attention to Lillie, and when he is away, the Prince tries to seduce her. Lillie flees in tears after another kiss, afraid of her own emotions. Finally, she embraces the Prince when he tries again, after John has left to see other plantations. But he returns early and sees their silhouette against the shade, his first awareness of what was going on. Alerted by the sound of the gate opening, the Prince quickly sends Lillie to her room and substitutes a servant in his arms. But the ploy doesn't work as John find Lillie's trinket on the sofa. John suggests tiger hunting at night and goads the Prince into going with him. A tiger is spotted and when the Prince lifts his gun and fires, it becomes apparent John removed the bullets from his gun. Stunned by facing both the tiger and an angry John with a loaded gun, he flees, with the tiger in pursuit. John raises his gun and fires.",

Edward is able to check out Johnny's background before giving his approval, he hoping Johnny is like his own father who was self-made. However, free-spirited Linda sees in Johnny the boost of joie de vivre the Seton family desperately needs. Despite being happy for Julia and her approval of Johnny as a prospective member of the family, Linda laments losing in Julia one of her comrades in arms in the battle against the conservative repression within the Seton family, led by their father, and their cousins Seton and Laura Cram. What Johnny confides in Linda is his want to retire temporarily from business life when he is financially able to do so - meaning not off the Seton wealth - so that he can both enjoy life while he's young by taking an extended holiday and so that he can truly find what in life he wants to do, work which he will return to once he's found that thing and his money has run out. He may be able to do so earlier than he expected as some investments are paying off, he who may be able to quit work before the wedding. Linda wholehearted admires Johnny's plan and hopes the best for him in going through with it. When Johnny's plan comes to light within the entire family, it may threaten Johnny and Julia's relationship, and may fully bring into the open the true kindred souls within this new grouping.",

The only exception is elderly socialite Mrs. Cliveden-Banks, who is off to meet her husband, Bunny. The only other passengers aboard are Catholic priest Reverend William Duke, wealthy business owner Mr. Lingley for who Tom used to work, and an uneducated working class elderly woman named Mrs. Midget. The only crew member is Scrubby, the steward. Tom eventually deciphers the nature of their trip, quicker than most that have taken it before have done. Before they reach their final destination, they each meet with a man named Thompson to discuss their life. Henry and Ann also want to meet with Thompson to take their pact to its intended conclusion, which may not be possible since they are not officially on the passenger list.",

Cherry is up front to him that it is a dangerous business in that Fred Marsh has set up a syndicate to control the salmon fishery in Alaska, he going to the extreme of killing to achieve his goal. As Boyd uses Cherry's connections to try and secure financing to build a cannery while Balt's men operate the fishing side of the business, several issues complicate matters. First, Marsh is Wayne Wayland's preference as a husband for Mildred. Second, Cherry herself has fallen in love with Boyd, something she doesn't want to let him know. And third, Cherry has not informed Boyd why she is so well off and has all her business connections, which was through her former work as a prostitute.",

    "plot": "Having just reached adulthood, Clyde Griffiths has always lamented his lot in life, he the only son of poor missionaries. He has gotten a peripheral view of society life, to which he aspires, in his work as a bellhop at an upscale hotel. If being truthful to himself, he would admit that he lacks moral strength, he often taking the easiest but perhaps not the most ethical path to protect himself. Forced to move from place to place out of circumstance, he ends up in Lycurgus, New York working at the Samuel Griffiths Collar and Shirt factory, Samuel Griffiths his paternal uncle. Not knowing his uncle or his family, Clyde only wants a chance to get ahead, not expecting anything else from his wealthy relations. After an apprenticeship, Clyde ends up as the foreman in the stamping department. Despite a company rule forbidding foremen to fraternize with staff, especially those working in the same department, Clyde begins an affair, a clandestine one out of necessity, with Roberta Alden, who works in the stamping department under him. Their love is an obsessive one, made all the more powerful due to its clandestine nature. That changes for Clyde when he meets, through his wealthy relations, society maiden Sondra Finchley, the two who immediately fall in love with each other. The extra draw of Sondra over Bert is Sondra's standing in society. By this time, Bert informs him that she is pregnant with his child, she pressuring him to do right by her in getting married. Wanting to be with Sondra instead, Clyde contemplates murdering Bert by drowning her in a lake, he knowing that she doesn't know how to swim. Although Clyde is ultimately unable to commit this act of murder and will do right in marrying Bert, he, due to that lack of moral strength, nonetheless is caught in a resulting tragic situation for all involved.",

Unknown to the theater going public and despite being married for only six months, that magic seems no longer to translate to their personal life, where they are constantly arguing, even under their breaths during on-stage curtain calls. These arguments stem from the actress' moody behavior, which the actor believes means that she no longer loves him and that she is looking for another man to replace him in her personal life. He believes she even scans the audience for potential suitors, probably being most attracted to the soldier type. Their feuding is at a point where they take pot shots at each other about everything in their lives, even the quality of the other's acting. The actor may have a valid point as the actress has been receiving bouquets of roses of late and a Russian guardsman has been seen hanging around outside their home. The actor knows these things as he is that Russian guardsman (who is also a Russian prince) in disguise, he who is also sending the flowers as the guardsman. He wants to see if this guardsman can indeed woo his wife away from him, and thus show her for who she really is. He concocts a further scheme to pretend to be out of town for a 24 hour period on another acting engagement, during which time he will try and seduce her as the guardsman. But the actress may throw some wrenches into his plan.",

Said to be \"as well-known as the Eiffel Tower,\" the popular and free-spirited Yvonne has served as the inspiration to some of the greatest artists and writers in Europe. At a party attended by bohemians and artists, Yvonne becomes bored by the pretentious guests, including Coutant, who tries to rekindle his romance with the model to no avail. Yvonne sulks in a corner until she meets the handsome André Montell, who, to her astonishment, is not an artist, but a student studying at the Consular Service. Immediately taken by André, Yvonne suggests that they leave the party. Yvonne neglects to tell her husband Vignaud, whom she does not love, that she is leaving with another man. She also neglects to tell André that she is married. A romance between André and the model soon flourishes, and Yvonne shows her willingness to give up the security and comfort of her marriage for André. Meanwhile, André is visited by his uncle Julian and Madeleine, a childhood playmate of his. Yvonne instantly becomes jealous of André's attentions to Madeleine. Later, after Yvonne tells her husband that she does not plan to return to him, she tries to throw him out of his own house. André, overhearing the fracas, realizes that Yvonne is married and after apologizing to Vignaud for the affair, leaves. Later, while modeling for Coutant, Yvonne tells André that she loves only him, but she is immediately attacked by Odette, a jealous model who insinuates that Yvonne is a wanton woman with a sordid past. Although Yvonne tries to convince André that the allegations are not true, he does not believe her and tells her that he wants to forget that he ever knew her. On her way out, Yvonne slaps Odette for driving André away. Time passes, and Yvonne, destitute, walks by André on the street near his school, but he ignores her. When Yvonne is unable to pay a small bill at a nearby cafe, André sees her distress and pays it for her. He then takes her to dinner and realizes that she has been living like a pauper. Before André leaves for Algiers, Yvonne discovers that he is going to marry another woman and calls him a coward and a liar for not telling her earlier. Tragedy strikes when Yvonne's friend Liane Latour commits suicide after being spurned by playboy Delval. Shocked by the news, André fears the same fate may befall Yvonne and decides to return to her. However, since André last saw Yvonne, she has been seeing Mr. Normand, an ex-lover who was imprisoned for writing bad checks. Intent on preventing her suicide, André pleads with Yvonne to marry him, and she accepts. Later, though, Yvonne realizes that he came back to her out of sympathy. After writing André a farewell letter, in which she tells him to forget her and marry the right woman, Yvonne leaves him.",

He now runs a scandal sheet in Paris, living on the money he mulcts out of wealthy Americans who conduct secret rendezvous in Paris, but as a gentleman racketeer, Michael refuses to blackmail women. Michael's latest victim is Harold Taylor, the soft coal baron of Pennsylvania. Posing as a novelist, Michael befriends Taylor by suggesting that he prosecute the editor of a scandal sheet who is about to print a story about him and a blonde. Taylor asks Michael to give the editor $2,000 to keep quiet, and Michael pockets the money. He then meets Taylor's charming niece, Mary Kendall, who is in Paris with her suitor, Frank Thompson, whom she does not love. While Frank is in London on business, Mary and Michael fall in love and he confesses his true identity, but promises to reform, and she accepts his proposal. Michael's ex-girl friend, Irene Harper, who helps him run the scandal sheet, was hoping that Michael would swindle Taylor out of enough money for her to post bail for her kid brother in America. When Michael tells her that he and Mary are going to marry, Irene flies into a jealous rage and convinces Michael he will never be allowed to go straight and that marriage to an ex-con would be unfair to Mary. To convince Mary that he was a crook all along, Michael goes to Taylor with a scandalous story about Mary and Michael visiting a notorious inn, and demands $10,000 to keep quiet. Mary, heartbroken, slaps Michael across the face, but agrees to have her uncle write Michael a check. Irene, meanwhile, has tipped off the police, and they politely ask Michael to leave the country. Irene then confesses that she pawned her jewelry to post bail for her brother after she realized Michael really loved Mary. Frank and Mary then sail home to America while Michael and Irene sail to Capetown, South Africa. On the ship's deck, Michael rips up Taylor's check and throws it overboard.",

Skippy's father, Dr. Herbert Skinner, the city's head of the health board, in particular doesn't like Skippy spending time there as Dr. Skinner is a verminophobe, and believes Shantytown is dirty and unhealthy. On Skippy's latest visit to Shantytown when he meets a new friend named Sooky Wayne, he learns that Shantytown is being torn down and its poor residents have to move. And Sooky's mongrel and unlicensed (since Mrs. Wayne can't afford the $3 license fee) dog Penny is captured by the city's dog catcher. As Skippy does whatever he can to raise the $3 to get Penny back for his new friend (which includes breaking into his piggy bank, holding a variety show for the Shantytown kids, and trying to ask his father for the money), Skippy learns that one person seems to be responsible for both these problems in his life, which makes the already tenuous relationship with this person even more tenuous.",

After composing herself following receiving this devastating news, Nancy, who still loves Don and wants to be with him, decides that there are better ways of getting him back than to be the devastated wife. Acting the modern woman, Nancy pretends that she too has fallen in love with another man she met in Europe. As the other man, she uses the unwitting help of Brit, Sir Guy Harrington, a man she met on the transatlantic sailing back to New York, he who is merely an acquaintance but who is often viewed as the most eligible bachelor in all Britain. Beyond setting in motion her plan which includes her modern self inviting Peggy and her mother to spend the weekend at their estate, Nancy has to try and convince Sir Guy to help her, which may not be an easy thing to do since he himself is attracted to her, and thus would like to see her and Don break up.",

On the ward, the women have varied feelings about motherhood. Mrs. West, mother of six children, thinks babies are what give meaning to women's lives. In contrast, Florette, a showgirl, just wants to get rid of her twins as soon as possible. Miss Layton has decided opinions about child rearing and has no intention of being a doting mother. While the women debate their various theories, a woman who wants a baby so much that she has become demented wanders in from another ward. An Italian woman quietly sobs when she learns that her newborn has died. After a touching farewell with Jed, Grace, whose health has suffered from prison conditions, is taken into the labor room. While Jed waits anxiously, Florette is appalled by the plans that the prospective adoptive mother of her twins has concocted. She cradles one baby herself and discovers mother love. Miss Layton has also given up on her progressive plans for her baby. Down the hall, things are going badly for Grace. When the doctors ask Jed to choose between saving Grace or the baby, he chooses Grace, but she herself insists that the doctors operate and save the baby. After she dies, Jed refuses to see the baby girl, but wise Nurse Bowers places the child in his arms, and as with the mothers, he cannot resist her charms.",

Barton counsels Pinkerton that he can 'marry' this beautiful Japanese girl, enjoy himself with cultural approval, then sail happily on back to America unshackled, since abandonment equates divorce in Japan. Barton assures Pinkerton that once abandoned, Cho-Cho will be free to marry whomever she chooses from amongst the Japanese people. When Pinkerton's ship sails out of port, Butterfly waits patiently for her husband to come home. Three years pass. Ever with her eye toward the harbor, Butterfly holds a secret delight that she eagerly wishes to surprise her husband with: their son. Pinkerton arrives in Japan with his American bride by his side. He goes to Butterfly to make his apologies and to finally end what Butterfly for three years has cherished in her heart.",

She persuades the studio to put him in a western parody, not telling him what they're really planning, because they know that he does not like comedies.

Be it a piece of melon or just a smile, his mother refuses it to him. She grabs every opportunity to express her frustration. One night, when she realizes that Red Head relieves himself in the chimney, because she had locked his door before going to bed, she puts his chamber pot under his bed to make it look like he had had the choice - only to be able to punish him afterwards. The only one who realizes Madame Lepic's cruelties is the maid Annette, who subsequently takes care of the boy. His wishes of a picture perfect family is something Red Head cannot stop thinking about, since all he wants is to be loved. When money is missing from the family purse and Red Head is suspected of stealing and this situation degenerates into a massive falling out between the parents, Red Head feels more responsible than ever for the failed marriage. Plagued by the feeling that he is unloved - and maybe even not loving his own mother anymore - he seeks shelter and security with his best friend, the dog. In his desperation he only sees one way to betterment, even redemption. Red Head, however, is not quite as alone as he had hitherto believed .",

Davidson is more than just a religious zealot; he's a mad man. When the boat, which was en route to another port, is temporarily stranded on the island due to a possible Cholera outbreak on-board, Sadie spends her time \"partying\" with the American soldiers stationed on the island. Her behavior, however, is more than the Davidsons can stand and soon Mr. Davidson confronts Sadie about her evil ways and offers salvation. When Sadie rebels and the attempted redemption does not go as planned, Davidson arranges to have her sent back to San Francisco, where she fled some years ago due to mysterious personal issues. Davidson soon becomes unhinged and thus begins a series of surprising events which culminate in disaster.",

As Tony is thinking bigger than Johnny and is not afraid of anyone or anything, Tony increasingly makes decisions on his own instead of following Johnny's orders, especially in not treading on the north side run by an Irish gang led by a man named O'Hara, of whom Johnny is afraid. Tony's murder spree increases, he taking out anyone who stands in his and Johnny's way of absolute control on the south side, and in Tony's view absolute control of the entire city. Tony's actions place an unspoken strain between Tony and Johnny to the point of the two knowing that they can't exist in their idealized world with the other. Tony's ultimate downfall may be one of two women in his life: Poppy, Johnny's girlfriend to who Tony is attracted; and Tony's eighteen year old sister, Cesca, who is self-professed to be older mentally than her years much to Tony's chagrin, he who will do anything to protect her innocence.

They are only able to get passing grades by helping each other cheat on exams. The four like to hang out at the bakery across the street from the college largely because of Shigeko, who works there, she who they consider the unofficial fifth in their group. While each is romantically interested in her, they have an unspoken pact not to go there with her in sharing her equally as a friend. One of the banes of Tetsuo's existence is his paternal uncle, Kanzô Horino, always trying to play matchmaker, the women he choosing for Tetsuo in who he has no interest as seeing many of them as gold-diggers, with his father, Kanzô's brother Kenzô Horino, helping Tetsuo come up with creative ways to dissuade these women. After Kenzô unexpectedly and suddenly passes away, Tetsuo is forced to leave college as he is installed as the president of the family's lucrative company, Horino Trading. With the company still doing well one year later, Tetsuo reconnects with his three just graduated friends from college, they who come looking for jobs. As some things don't change between them, some may under this circumstance as they are all one year older and embarking on their adult lives, as the balance of power has shifted with Tetsuo as boss and Saiki, Kumada and Shimazaki as his employees, and as Shige also reenters Tetsuo's life in a slightly different vein.",

When Molly arrives at Ralph's house to finally meet his mother she is informed that both Ralph and his mother have been called out-of-town suddenly and that the dinner has been canceled. Heartbroken and carrying Ralph's unborn child, Molly takes to the road with Nicky Grant, a small-time crook from her past. A couple years pass and she leaves her daughter in the care of another woman. One night her old friend Jimmy and his college pals visit the dance hall where Molly works as a hostess. Jimmy and Molly are happy to see one another and catch up on old times. Drunk and jealous, Nicky orders Molly and Jimmy into a car he has stolen. When the police spot the car, Nicky fires some shots and runs into an alley, hitting an officer before being wounded himself. Molly drives off in the car with Jimmy. With a cop dead, the entire city is on the lookout for the brunette mystery girl who drove the getaway car. Molly dyes her hair blonde and moves with Jimmy into an inconspicuous apartment to lay low. Their neighbor is Scotty Cornell, a streetwise newspaperman. Soon the police learn Molly's name and suspect her of being the brains behind Nicky's whole gang. Jimmy wants Molly to go away with him and get married, but Scotty counters with an offer to take her to Paris for some laughs. Molly is torn between her desire to at last be respectable with Jimmy and her attraction to Scotty, who may be more \"her type\". Meanwhile Scotty hatches a plan to catch the fugitive Ms. Louvain by broadcasting that her daughter is gravely ill. Molly turns herself in to the police in order to help her child, but finds it is only a ruse. Scotty is shocked to learn that the mystery woman he set the trap for is his own Molly. Touched by her maternal devotion, he recognizes that she is not the tramp he took her for and promises to drum up enough support in the press to keep her out of jail.",

While Mary's life took a positive turn since her reformatory years, Vivian has come to the realization that she is unhappy with her life, its path a little too easy in its predetermination. She realizes she probably never loved Robert. Her quest for pleasure, with a blessing of sorts from Robert who doesn't want his wife, whom he still loves, to be as distant as she seems, will affect Mary, as well. Their collective destinies may be foreshadowed by an old wives' tale about three sharing a single match, from which the film takes its name.",

The boys get off to a rocky start in their new neighborhood as they end up being bullied by a group of similarly aged boys, led by slightly bigger Kamekichi. Keiji and Ryoichi even secretly play hooky from school, not wanting to have to confront the bullies. After befriending Kozou, the older delivery boy at the local store who ends up being their protector of sorts, Keiji and Ryoichi are able to stand up to their tormentors to become the ones among the boys who call the shots. Their newfound pride takes a hit when they end up being at the same social gathering as their father and his coworkers at Iwasaki's house, and see that their father is a proverbial apple-polisher toward Iwasaki and not the important man they previously believed him to be. Kennesuke knows how his behavior looks to his sons, but justifies it to himself by probably being further ahead in life than they would be otherwise. The Yoshis will have to reconcile these two issues for harmony to return within their family.",

Touched by the Ruth's sincerity, he vows to help her buy a ticket to Salt Lake City, where a job awaits her. Scrap Iron is lucky too, stumbling across a wallet with a claim check discarded by a pickpocket. When Chick claims the violin case, he finds it filled with cash, unbeknownst to him, counterfeit.

So after a failed relationship with soldier Captain Lafe Resnick which includes a deeper personal tragedy for her, Ann decides instead to focus solely on her career. With a background in nursing and social work, she decides the area of her work will be in prison reform. Her lofty goals do not sit well with many of the male traditionalists in the field, they who may stop her from accomplishing what she wants, at her own personal reputation at risk. Although she has a multitude of wannabe suitors, it isn't until she meets Supreme Court judge Barney Dolphin that she contemplates having that fulfilling personal life at the same time as having a career. But the road to a possible happy ending for Ann and Barney will be a difficult one as he is already married (although he has long wanted a divorce, even before meeting Ann) and as he goes through a career threatening issue which may tarnish his good name.",

It isn't until he moves in that he discovers a special bond with the house. Upon the discovery of further artifacts of his ancestors who had previously lived there, including a detailed diary, Peter comes to believe that he is destined to walk into the house at 5:30pm on September 3rd to assume the life of one of those ancestors. That man, also named Peter Standish, was an American officer in Washington's army who walked into the house for the first time at the same moment on the same day 149 years earlier in 1784, shortly after the American Revolution. Then, it was the home of Standish's distant cousins, the Pettigrews - Lady Ann and her three offspring Tom, Helen and Kate, who would become Mrs. Standish in an arranged marriage. Peter believes he knows what he should do so as not to change history by the details listed in Standish's diary. Indeed, Peter's prognostication does become his reality. Beyond doing what is stated in the diary, Peter has to be careful not to divulge information which has yet to happen or that he should not know, and to limit his use of 20th-century English-language idioms. As hard as he tries, Peter's actions have the potential to alter the course of his own history and his imminent wedding in present day to Marjorie Trant. His experience in 1784 may also bring to light the meaning of certain items as symbols of eternal love.",

After the long night of winter, Mala does go with his family to the white man's \"floating house\" in Tjarnak. The friendly captain makes trade for Mala's excellent furs, but upsets Mala when he insists that Aba sleep with him that night. \"He didn't even ask me!\" Mala complains. Afterwards, the captain suggests that Mala go whale hunting and promises not to touch his wife, so Mala agrees. But news of a successful catch spurs a celebration on board ship, and the captain has Aba forcibly removed from her tent, plied with liquor, and then he rapes her. In the morning, the still-drunk Aba staggers from the ship, but collapses in the snow, where she is mistaken for an animal by a hunter and shot and killed. When Mala returns from the whaling expedition, he learns that Aba \"has swallowed sleep.\" He is so enraged he harpoons the captain, packs up his dog sled team and leaves with the rest of his family. It takes some time to recover from his grief and take on two new wives including Iva, who has loved him all along. The newly formed Royal Canadian Mounted Police learns of the murder and dispatches two mounties to arrest Mala. Ironically, Mala finds them frozen in the snow, near death, and saves their lives reluctantly, since he now trusts no white man. But they convince him they are his friends and must go back with them or else they may starve. So he goes, leaving his family behind. At the RCMP base, Mala learns from a translator he may hang. With great effort, he slips out of his shackled wrist, injuring his hand, steals food and a dog sled team and heads back to his land. In the morning, the two mounties go after him.",
